## How I keep myself growth mindset 

**1. first** ,I look to my weekness points  as anew starting points to develop my self 

**2. second** , I always looking forward new things to try it And do my best to success 

**3. finally** , I deleted "impossible" word from my brain and alweys remember my self "i can do it ,and i can learn,no problem with fail".
