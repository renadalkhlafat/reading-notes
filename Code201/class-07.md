# Tables in HTML 
**HTML table tag** is used to display data in tabular form (row * column). There can be many columns in a row.

We can create a table to display data in tabular form, using <table> element, with the help of <tr> , <td>, and <th> elements.

In Each table, table row is defined by <tr> tag, table header is defined by <th>, and table data is defined by <td> tags.

HTML tables are used to manage the layout of the page e.g. header section, navigation bar, body content, footer section etc. But it is recommended to use div tag over table to manage the layout of the page .

# Function & Methodes 
JavaScript** Functions**: A function is a block of code written to perform some specific set of tasks. We can define a function using the function keyword, followed by Name and optional parameters. Body of function is enclosed in Curly braces.

JavaScript **Methods**: A JavaScript method is a property of an object that contains a function definition. Methods are functions stored as object properties.

# Objects

**objects** are used to store keyed collections of various data and more complex entities. In JavaScript, objects penetrate almost every aspect of the language. So we must understand them first before going in-depth anywhere else.

An object can be created with figure brackets {…} with an optional list of properties. A property is a “key: value” pair, where key is a string (also called a “property name”), and value can be anything.
