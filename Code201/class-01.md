# How to build a perfect website ?

** To build an effective and perfect website, you need to follow these steps :**

+ Determine the identity of the site .
+ Determine the target group for the site .
+ Determine the structure of the site Using **WIREFRAME** .

**Wireframing** is a process where designers draw overviews of interactive products to establish the structure and flow of possible design solutions. These outlines reflect user and business needs. 

Ether Paper or software-rendered wireframes help teams and stakeholders ideate toward optimal, user-focused prototypes and products.

+ Use **HTML** to build the structure of the site and define its contents.

**HTML** (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).

+ Common Tags in HTML
  +  < html>
  +  < head>
  +  < body>
  + < title>
  +  < a>
  +  < span>
  +  < strong>
  +  < header>
  +  < footer>
  +  < nav>,etc.

+ Improve the appearance and presentation of the site using **CSS**

![css](https://static.javatpoint.com/csspages/images/css-syntax.png )

**CSS** allows you to apply specific styles to specific HTML elements.

The main benefit of CSS is that it allows you to separate style from content.

Using just HTML, all the styles and formatting are in the same place, which becomes rather difficult to maintain as the page grows.

#### Three Ways to Insert CSS

There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

- External CSS
- Internal CSS
- Inline CSS

[Examples](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_howto.asp)


### Rule syntax:

    style-rule ::=
    selectors-list {
      properties-list
     }
**Example** : 

      strong {
     color: red;
     }

#### Color in CSS
- Using the name of the color 
- using the HEX value for the color 
- Using RGB 

**Example** :

     body {
     color: red;
      }

    h1 {
    color: #00ff00;
     }

    p.ex {
    color: rgb(0,0,255);
     }

+ To make the site more interactive and meaningful and to improve the functionality of the site we use **JavaScript**

**JavaScript** is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) 
  
  - At this stage, the tasks must be divided into steps and a** Flow Chart** should be drawn to facilitate and simplify the process of writing the code

**A flowchart** is a type of diagram that represents a workflow or process. A flowchart can also be defined as a diagrammatic representation of an algorithm, a step-by-step approach to solving a task. The flowchart shows the steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting the boxes with arrows.
