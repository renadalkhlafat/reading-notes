[Loops](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/loop)
 are used in JavaScript to perform repeated tasks based on a condition. Conditions typically return true or false when analysed. A loop will continue running until the defined condition returns false . 
  + For loop

Syntax  :
         
          for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3)
            { execute code block}

** Example : **

           for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++){
           console.log(i)}

  + While loop

Syntax:

         while (condition){
          execute code block}
** Example : **

     var i = 0;

    while(i < 5){
    console.log(i)
    i++}


**NOW** to use them we should learn about the Expressions and operators

- [Operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#operators),such as 

  + Logical operators >>>Such as (AND , OR ,XOR ,etc . ) for more information click [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#logical_operators)
