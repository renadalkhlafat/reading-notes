# Random Module
Module that provides access to functions that support many operations ,we use it when we need to pick random number in given range of elements or list .

## Random functions
+ Randint : to genarate random integer ,it takes two parameters (lowest, highest )

+ Random :to genarate large random integer 

+ Choice : to genarate random value from a list 

+ Shuffle : to shuffle the elements in list in place(randomly) 

+ Randrange : to generate a randomly selected element from range, it takes three parameter (start, stop, step) the step parameter is an optional one 


# Risk Analysis
The process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test.we make it to take the risks in consideration along the possibility of the damage they may cause to your software along with solutions.

## Possible risks that you could encounter
+ Use of new hardware
+ Use of new technology
+ Use of new automation tool
+ The sequence of code
+ Availability of test resources for the application

## Unavoidable risks
+ The time that you allocated for testing

+ A defect leakage due to the complexity or size of the application

+ Urgency from the clients to deliver the project

+ Incomplete requirements

## Test Coverage
A useful tool for finding untested parts of a codebase.It's of little use as a numeric statement of how good your tests are, and we use it to know if we are testing enough or not 

## Big O Notation
The worst case analysis of algorithm efficiency.

+ Roles to find Big O 
    - Different step got added 
    - Drop constants
    - Different inputs => different output
    - Drop non-dominate terms
