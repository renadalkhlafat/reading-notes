# JupyterLab 
A web-based user interface that enable us to work with documents and activities such as `Jupyter notebooks`,` text editors`, `terminals`, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner

## The Jupyter Notebook
An open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.

## Jupyter shortcuts :

y -> cellformat : Code 

m -> cell format : Markdown 

SHEFT + ENTER : Run cell 

0 0 : Restart kernel 

a -> add a cell above 

b -> add a cell below

C -> copy cell 
 
v -> paste cell 

x -> cut cell 

z -> undo 

SHEFT + z -> redo 


# NumPy 
A data analysis package in python which stands for **Numerical Python** that provides  comprehensive mathematical functions, random number generators, linear algebra routines, Fourier transforms, and a multidimensional array object, as well as variations such as masks and matrices, which can be used for various math operations .

What can we do using Numpy?
+ 2-Dimensional Arrays
    - Creating A NumPy Array
    - Alternative NumPy Array Creation Methods (numpy.zeros)
    - Using NumPy To Read In Files 
    - Indexing NumPy Arrays
    - Slicing NumPy Arrays
    - Assigning Values To NumPy Arrays

## NumPy Data Types
- *float* — numeric floating point data.
- *int* — integer data.
- *string* — character data.
- *object* — Python objects.

## NumPy Array Methods
- numpy.ndarray.sum — inds the sum of all the elements in an array
- numpy.ndarray.mean — finds the mean of an array.
- numpy.ndarray.std — finds the standard deviation of an array.
- numpy.ndarray.min — finds the minimum value in an array.
- numpy.ndarray.max — finds the maximum value in an array.
