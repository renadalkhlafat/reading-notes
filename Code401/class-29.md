#  Django’s user models
**Django’s user models** have to do with authentication and storing data about users. When you start a default Django project, your project is configured to use the default user model.

The default user model makes it possible for users to log in to your site using a username and password. You get user-related functionality such as limiting access to some parts of the site to authenticated users and the admin functionality for free.
