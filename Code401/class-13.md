# Linear Regression
A linear approach for modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables 

## Simple Linear Regression
a linear regression model with a single explanatory variable 
`𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑏₀ + 𝑏₁𝑥`

## Multiple Linear Regression
 a statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable.

 `𝑓(𝑥₁, 𝑥₂) = 𝑏₀ + 𝑏₁𝑥₁ + 𝑏₂𝑥₂`

 ## Polynomial Regression
 a form of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y is modelled as an nth degree polynomial in x. ... For this reason, polynomial regression is considered to be a special case of multiple linear regression

`𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑏₀ + 𝑏₁𝑥 + 𝑏₂𝑥².`

 ### Underfitting 
 occurs when a model can’t accurately capture the dependencies among data, usually as a consequence of its own simplicity.


 ### Overfitting
  happens when a model learns both dependencies among data and random fluctuations

### Scikit-learn 
is a powerful Python module for machine learning. It contains function for regression, classification, clustering, model selection and dimensionality reduction
