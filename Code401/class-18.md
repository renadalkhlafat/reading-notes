# Encryption, Decryption & Hacking

**Encryption**: Securing digital data using one or more mathematical techniques, along with a password or "key" used to decrypt the information. The encryption process translates information using an algorithm that makes the original information unreadable

**Decryption**:  transforms encrypted information into its original format

**Hacking**: Activities that seek to compromise digital devices, such as computers, smartphones, tablets, and even entire networks.

**Cracking** :  a technique used in oil refineries whereby large and complex hydrocarbon molecules are broken down into smaller and lighter components

## Caesar cipher
The shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
