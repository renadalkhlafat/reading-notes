# CSS
 
**CSS** allows you to apply specific styles to specific HTML elements.

The main benefit of CSS is that it allows you to separate style from content.

Using just HTML, all the styles and formatting are in the same place, which becomes rather difficult to maintain as the page grows.

## Three Ways to Insert CSS

There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

- External CSS
- Internal CSS
- Inline CSS

[Examples](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_howto.asp)


## Rule syntax:

    style-rule ::=
    selectors-list {
      properties-list
     }
**Example** : 

      strong {
     color: red;
     }

## Color in CSS
- Using the name of the color 
- using the HEX value for the color 
- Using RGB 

**Example** :

     body {
     color: red;
      }

    h1 {
    color: #00ff00;
     }

    p.ex {
    color: rgb(0,0,255);
     }
