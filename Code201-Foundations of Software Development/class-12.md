# Chart.js
Chart.js is a powerful data visualization library, but I know from experience that it can be tricky to just get started and get a graph to show up. There are all sorts of things that can wrong, and I often just want to have something working so I can start tweaking it.
it's comes with the following built-in chart types:

# Colors
Up until now we have only seen methods of the drawing context. If we want to apply colors to a shape, there are two important properties we can use: fillStyle and strokeStyle.

`fillStyle = color`

Sets the style used when filling shapes.

`strokeStyle = color`

Sets the style for shapes' outlines.

color is a string representing a CSS `<color>`, a gradient object, or a pattern object. We'll look at gradient and pattern objects later. By default, the stroke and fill color are set to black (CSS color value` #000000`).

# HTML Canvas Graphics

The HTML` <canvas>` element is used to draw graphics on a web page.

The graphic to the left is created with `<canvas>`. It shows four elements: a red rectangle, a gradient rectangle, a multicolor rectangle, and a multicolor text.
