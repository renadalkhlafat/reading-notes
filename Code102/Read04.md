JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) 

###### Here is three oparators in JS

### Arithmetic operators
| Operator	                       | Description |
| -----------                          | ----------- |	
|Remainder (%)	Binary operator.       |Returns the integer remainder of dividing the two operands.|	
|Increment (++)	Unary operator.        |Adds one to its operand. If used as a prefix operator (++x),returns the value of its operand after adding one; if used as a postfix operator (x++),returns the value of its operand before adding one.|	
|Decrement (--)	Unary operator.        |Subtracts one from its operand. The return value is analogous to that for the increment operator.|	
|Unary negation (-)Unary operator.     |Returns the negation of its operand.|	
|Unary plus (+)	Unary operator.        |Attempts to convert the operand to a number, if it is not already.|	
|Exponentiation operator (**)	       |Calculates the base to the exponent power, that is, base^exponent |	


### Assignment operators

| Operator	                | Description |
| -----------               | ----------- |
|Assignment	                |x = y	      | 
|Addition assignment	      |x += y	      |
|Subtraction assignment	    |x -= y	      |
|Multiplication assignment	|x *= y	      |
|Division assignment	      |x /= y	      |
|Remainder assignment	      |x %= y	      |



### Comparison operators

| Operator	                | Description |
| -----------                   | ----------- |
| Equal (==)	                |Returns true if the operands are equal.|
|Not equal (!=)  	        |Returns true if the operands are not equal.|
|Strict equal (===)	        |Returns true if the operands are equal and of the same type. See also Object.is and sameness in JS.|	
|Strict not equal (!==)	        |Returns true if the operands are of the same type but not equal, or are of different type.|	
|Greater than (>)	        |Returns true if the left operand is greater than the right operand.|	
|Greater than or equal (>=)	|Returns true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.|	
|Less than (<)	                |Returns true if the left operand is less than the right operand.|
|Less than or equal (<=)	| Returns true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.|



## Control flow in JS
+ [If conditional](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Conditional)
** Example : **
 
if (field==empty) {
    Do something ;
} else {
     Do something ;
}

+ [Loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/loop)
  + For loop
Syntax:
          for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3)
            { execute code block}
** Example : **

for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++){
    console.log(i)
}
  + While loop
Syntax:
while (condition){
 execute code block
}

** Example : **
     var i = 0;
while(i < 5){
    console.log(i)
    i++
}
