# Function 
**JavaScript function**, function is a group of code designed to perform a particular task.

## Function declarations

A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

- The name of the function.
- A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
- The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}.

**Example** :

     function square(number) {
      return number * number;
      }


## Types of function:
- anonymous function ((function () {});_)
- named function 
- inner function 
- recursive function
- Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE) 



## Calling 

Defining a function does not execute it. Defining it names the function and specifies what to do when the function is called.

Calling the function actually performs the specified actions with the indicated parameters.

**Example** :

      square(5);
