## nosql vs sql

|SQL |  NoSQL |
| ------------ | -------------|
| SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases  | NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database|
| table based databases |document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores|
| SQL databases have predefined schema  | NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.|
| SQL databases are vertically scalable  |  NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable|
| SQL databases are scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware  | NoSQL databases are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load|

___
1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

`for the complex query intensive environment `

2. Give a real world example.

`MySQL Community Edition`

3. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

`for the hierarchical data storage`

4. Give a real world example.

`MongoDB`

5. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

`NoSQL databases`

6. Which type of database is best for scalability?

`SQL databases becuase are vertically scalable we can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc, on a single server`

7. What does SQL stand for?

`Structured Query Language`

8. What is a realational database?

` type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another,and enabled users to manage predefined data relationships across multiple databases`

9. What type of structure does a relational database work with?

`Tables`

10. What is a ‘schema’?

`diagram used to describe the structure of different types of data`

11. What is a NoSQL database?

`“not only SQL” is a structure for database design that enables the storage and querying of data outside the traditional structures found in relational databases`

12. How does it work?

`NoSQL is particularly useful for storing unstructured data, which is growing far more rapidly than structured data and does not fit the relational schemas of RDBMS`

13. What is inside of a Mongo database?

`data records as documents`

14. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

` MongoDB is more flexible becuase it is ensures high and diverse data availability`

15. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

`don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have `
