## React Docs - Forms
1. What is a ‘Controlled Component’?

`a component that renders form elements and controls them by keeping the form data in the component's state and the data is handled by the React component (not DOM) ` 

2. Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.

`when we use onChange method it we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them `

3. How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

`using the event.target.value`

2. Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

```
x===y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false)

```
